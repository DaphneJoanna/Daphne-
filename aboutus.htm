			A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates a demand deposit while simultaneously making loans. 
            Lending activities can be directly performed by the bank or indirectly through capital markets.<br><br>
            Because banks play an important role in financial stability and the economy of a country, most jurisdictions exercise a high degree of regulation over banks. Most countries have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking, under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities.<br><br>
            Banks are a very important part of the economy because they provide vital services for both consumers and businesses. As financial services providers, they give you a safe place to store your cash. Through a variety of account types such as checking and savings accounts.
